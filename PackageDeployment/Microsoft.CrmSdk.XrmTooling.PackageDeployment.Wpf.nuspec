Added initial support for several new features of package deployer around unified packaging for the power platform and keyvault intergration.
Added Support for Deployment Settings generated from the pac CLI to be provided as part of package deployment.
      This support requires that you base64encode the settings file ( by solution ) and pass string as a property in the /Settings: of the Package Deployer client. 
      The format to use is %solutionunqiuename%_deploymentsettings=%base64string%
      Multiple settings can be passed by using the Key=Value| format.

9.0.2.4:
  Updated install flows to more correctly trigger failures on failures within user code or data import.
  Added support several configuration settings dealing with timeouts and dials.
  Thease settings are set in the app.config of the host process
  StaleImportProgressOverride -
        This setting is the number of times a solution import be polled for progress.  This is rolling property, the count resets each time a solution moves forward.
          Default setting is 50
        Note: this property only applies when solutions import mode is sync.

      SolutionStatusPollingFrequencyOverride -
        This setting is the delay between check for solution progress.
          Default setting is :  5 (seconds)
        Note: this property only applies when solutions import mode is sync.

      SolutionImportBlockedRetryCountOverride -
        This setting is the number of retries that will be attempted when a solution import is blocked by a concurrent metadata operation.
          Default setting for this is 10

      SolutionImportBlockedWaitOverride -
        This setting is the number of seconds that a retry will wait before attempting another solution import.
          Default setting for this is 60 (seconds)

      UseAsyncForSolutionImport -
        This setting controls the default behavior of the import operations for Package Deployer.
          If set to true, Package deployer will attempt to use an Async Pattern for all solution operations where possible to do, given the server configuration.
          Default setting for this is false ( sync mode )

      Importconfig.xml - Solutions node updates.
        Added requiredimportmode as an option to force an Async or Sync import behavior for a given solution.
        This includes, upgrade or new install.
        Valid settings for this property are :
          async -  Requires the Import of this solution to be done in an async manner if the server supports it.
          sync - Requires the import of this solution to be done in a sync manner if the server supports it.
        Default behavior follows the default setting for the Package Deployer Core Process.

    9.0.2.3:
      Updated with Xrm.Tooling.Connector support
      Added new dependencies for Xrm.Tooling.Connector.dll
      Fixed issues that caused unhandled exceptions to be thrown when a package resulted in an error.
      Added new notifications in logs and UX for faults (where applicable).
      Added logic to detect stuck solution import and abort the import process

    9.0.0.7: 
Updated to include CAB compression DLL's.
      Fixed a bug in CMT Lookup processing logic that was causing incorrect linking where the data set includes records that require related lookup records which share the same default name.
